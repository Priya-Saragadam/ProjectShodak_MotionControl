# ProjectShodak_MotionControl
Project Shodak is an Open Lab project by S Lakshmi Priya and Ramaraju Padmvathi, 3rd year undergraduate students in ECE at Amrita School of Engineering, Bangalore campus.

1. What is Shodak?
Shodak is an automated vacuum cleaner that is capable to take intelligent decisions like direction identification, set appropriate speed , cover and clean most of the house area. 

2. What is the motivation?
Hygiene is a practice that helps us stay peaceful, clean and healthy. During the pandemic, in India, most of the people traveled back to their home towns and stayed with their family. Classes/tutions and IT jobs made people stick to their chairs with electronic gadgets in hand. This was also the time when people could not let domestic workers to help them maintain hygiene at their current place of stay as well as their nuclear place of stay. 

  The problem is easier way to clean and hygiene maintenance at home. So, we have come up with an automated vacuum cleaner, Shodak.
  Even when people are not at home, a simple SMS should invoke Shodak.

4. Objectives: 
(i) Able to move on its own
(ii) Able to choose appropriate direction
(iii) Capable of detecting and avoiding obstacles
(iv) Clean properly
(v) Stays in the same bounded room until the entire room is covered

5. Methodology: 
(i)To sense the obstacles and corners of a room, we need sensors like IR and Ultrasonic.
(ii)Data from the sensors could be used to calculate the room dimensions and area to be covered.
(iii)Once the motion of Shodak is controlled, we can attach the vacuum cleaning essentials to the pre-built system.
(iv)Using GSM module, we can enable the communication between the user and the Shodak.

6. Tasks involved: 
a. Acquire data from the real time world
b. Detect the walls and corners
c. Calculate the area to be covered
d. Detect any obstacles and avoid it
e. Clean the maximum possible area
f. To clean the floor, a good suction power must be adopted
g. Receive the message from user and turn on automatically
h. Start the suction process after calculating the room dimensions
i. Find an opening to move to the next room

7. Deliverables:
