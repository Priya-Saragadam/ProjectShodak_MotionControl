# Project Shodak
Shodak - A low noise and innovative cleaning device

1. What is Shodak?
Shodak is an automated low noise vacuum cleaner that is capable to take intelligent decisions like direction identification, set appropriate speed , cover and clean most of the house area. 

2. What is the motivation?
Hygiene is a practice that helps us stay peaceful, clean and healthy. During the pandemic, in India, most of the people traveled back to their home towns and stayed with their family. Classes/tutions and IT jobs made people stick to their chairs with electronic gadgets in hand. This was also the time when people could not let domestic workers to help them maintain hygiene at their current place of stay as well as their nuclear place of stay. 

  The problem is easier way to clean and maintain hygiene at home. So, we have come up with an automated vacuum cleaner, Shodak.

3. Objectives: 
(i) Able to move on its own
(ii) Able to choose appropriate direction
(iii) Capable of detecting and avoiding obstacles
(iv) Clean properly
(v) Stays in the same bounded room until the entire room is covered

4. Methodology: 
(i)To sense the obstacles and corners of a room, we need sensors like IR and Ultrasonic.
(ii)Data from the sensors could be used to understand if any obstacle has come on Shodak's way.
(iii)Once the motion of Shodak is controlled, we can attach the vacuum cleaning essentials to the pre-built system.

5. Tasks involved: 
a. Acquire data from the real time world
b. Detect the walls and corners if the system encounters
c. Detect any obstacles and avoid it
d. Clean the maximum possible area
e. To clean the floor, a good suction power must be adopted

Final product:
